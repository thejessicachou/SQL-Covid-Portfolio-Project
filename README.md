# Covid-Portfolio-Project

This was a follow along project by AlexTheAnalyst on Youtube and my first project. The project was taught with Microsoft SQL, and I used PostgreSQL as that is the program I am most comfortable using. It was interesting seeing the different lines of codes used for Micrsoft SQL vs PostgreSQL. Trying to find the solutions to translate the different queries was a fun puzzle to solve. 

The project also included a data visualization portion, which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDInfectionRatesDeaths/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
